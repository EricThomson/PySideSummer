#PySide Summer Chapter 10 (Events, the Clipboard, and Drag and Drop)
PySide translation of files for Chapter 10 of Mark Summerfield's 'Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt' (2008). Also see `usefulStuff.md` for helpful excerpts from the PySide documentation for relevant classes used in the files.

##Solution to exercise
Also included is one answer to the exercise. The new code is in _customdraganddropPyside_ans.py_. Summerfield also has answers (using PyQt) at the book's web site, which is probably better than my answer. 

##Notes about translation of Chapter 10
`QColor().light()` is deprecated. Use `QColor.lighter()` instead.
